# ModuTools Search

This Raycast extension has multiple commands, first there's the modutools search, which lets you search all the tools on https://beta.modu.tools, there's also the colour converter, which can convert hex, rgb, and hsl to hex, rgb, and hsl. Another command this extension has is timezone search, which lets you search every single timezone, and copy it to your clipboard. Finally, there's the uuid generator, which generates 8 UUIDs at a time, and you can copy whichever you want.
